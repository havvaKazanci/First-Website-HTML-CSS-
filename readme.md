This is my first HTML and CSS project. I created a web page using the instructions on MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Creating_the_content) I avoided copying and pasting to learn. 


With this project,
I learned basic HTML tags.
I learned how to style with CSS.
I learned how to bring a page to life with very simple Javascript code.

For download the codes as zip:
https://github.com/havvaKazanci/First-Website-HTML-CSS-/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

**Important:** After downloading, make sure to **extract all the files** before opening the website.  

If you open `index.html` directly from the ZIP without extracting, images may not load properly.
After extracting, open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website.

Thanks for checking out project!
