This is my first HTML and CSS project. I created a web page using the instructions on MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Creating_the_content) I avoided copying and pasting to learn. 


With this project,
I learned basic HTML tags.
I learned how to style with CSS.
I learned how to bring a page to life with very simple Javascript code.
